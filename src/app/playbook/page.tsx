            <p>Hi [Business Owner Name],</p>
            <p>I was thinking about [Their Business Name] and had an idea. Could an AI assistant on your website that instantly answers common customer questions 24/7 help save your team time (or capture more leads)?</p>
            <p>I help businesses like yours set these up using a simple platform called AutoBoss. It's surprisingly quick.</p>
            <p>Would you be open to a brief 10-15 minute chat sometime next week to see if this is something that could help you? No pressure at all, just a thought.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Best regards,</p>
