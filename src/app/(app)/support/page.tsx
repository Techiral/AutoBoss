// THIS FILE (`src/app/(app)/support/page.tsx`) IS CAUSING A ROUTE CONFLICT.
// The public support page is now at `/src/app/support/page.tsx`.
//
// PLEASE MANUALLY DELETE THIS FILE (`src/app/(app)/support/page.tsx`) FROM YOUR PROJECT.
//
// Leaving this file, even empty or with just this comment, might still cause issues
// depending on your Next.js version and build process. Deletion is the best solution.
//
// (This AI cannot delete files, so this content is a placeholder to prevent a build error
// from an empty file, but the conflict might persist until the file is truly removed.)
